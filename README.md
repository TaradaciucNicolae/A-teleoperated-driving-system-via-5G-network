# A teleoperated driving system via 5G network

This project introduces a versatile teleoperated driving system utilizing 5G
technology for control and user interactions. The system operates seamlessly
via an Xbox Series X Controller, providing an intuitive interface. It features a 5G
Module and a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, enabling high-speed data transmission
and real-time live feed streaming of the carâ€™s surroundings through a
repositionable Raspberry Pi Camera Board, allowing users to view the
environment of the smart car. 

It was programmed entirely in Python
and involved integrating the 5G Module with the Raspberry Pi, reading controller
inputs, transferring data via 5G, and programming the DC and servo motors for
steering and propulsion. This setup ensures consistent communication and real-
time interaction between the user and the car
